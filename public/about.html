<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The way I see life is the way everyone around me may think it is.
  Since I was a child I learned that we must love our fellow human beings, we must always stand out from others, without harming anyone.
  We must shine with our own light. In this life, which is fleeting, is borrowed, we must enjoy every moment.
  The time is gold</p>
